/*
(The Location class) Design a class named Location for locating a maximal
value and its location in a two-dimensional array.

The class contains public data
fields row, column, and maxValue that store the maximal value and its indices in
a two-dimensional array with row and column as int types and maxValue as a
double type.

Write the following method that returns the location of the largest element in a
two-dimensional array:
public static Location locateLargest(double[][] a)

The return value is an instance of Location.

Write a test program that prompts
the user to enter a two-dimensional array and displays the location of the largest
element in the array.

Sampel run:
Enter the number of rows and columns in the array: 3 4
Enter the array:
23.5 35 2 10
4.5 3 45 3.5
35 44 5.5 9.6
The location of the largest element is 45 at (1, 2)
