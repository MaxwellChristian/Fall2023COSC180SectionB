/*
* Write a program which takes input of 2 numbers from user.
* Both the numbers must  be different.
* Create two different arrays as per the two input numbers.
* Then the program generates random numbers and stores them
* in the two arrays.
* The program should then create a 3rd array and
* store the values from array1 followed by array2 in array3
*
* Ex:
* num1 : 5
* num2 : 7
* arr1 : 10, 78, 32, 45, 11
* arr2 : 100, 78, 75, 11, 11, 78, 75
* arr3 : 10, 78, 32, 45, 11, 100, 78, 75, 11, 11, 78, 75
